      "description": "The Heartbleed bug `CVE-2014-0160` is a severe implementation flaw in the OpenSSL library, which enables attackers to steal data from the memory of the victim server. The contents of the stolen data depend on what is there in the memory of the server. It could potentially contain private keys, TLS session keys, usernames, passwords, credit cards, etc. The vulnerability is in the implementation of the Heartbeat protocol, which is used by SSL/TLS to keep the connection alive.",
